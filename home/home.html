        <p>Heya, I’m Hazel, a transgender backend developer and student from the US with a passion for coding and game development. I work with languages like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Python, C#, and Java</span>, and I love creating projects like Android apps and even my own web browser. I’m always excited to learn new things, build cool stuff, and bring creative ideas to life.</p>

            <li>I go by She / They pronouns I’d prefer She/Her but either is fine</li>

            <li>My preferred name is Hazel (Hay • zull)</li>
            
            <li>I would prefer to be called with feminine compliments or gender neutral ones</li>
            
            <li>My voice gives me dysphoria (uncomfortable) sometimes so I don’t talk a lot and I don’t like when people talk about my voice</li>
            
            <li>Please don’t use any homophobic slurs or anything towards me or other people around me it makes me uncomfortable, even things like if you call me a femboy gives me dysphoria so please don’t.</li>
            
            <li>Please don’t compare me to any male people because that also makes me slightly uncomfortable</li>
